# GENESIS CONTRACT
# ONE-TIME INITIALIZATION AUTHORITY
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## PURPOSE

This contract governs the one-time initialization phase of a Bloom-based project.

GENESIS is a singular cognitive event that occurs exactly once per project.
GENESIS establishes the initial documentation baseline required for operational intents.
GENESIS is irreversible and must never execute after completion.

This is NOT documentation.
This is NOT an intent.
This is NOT reusable logic.

This is a cognitive execution boundary.

## EXECUTION WINDOW

GENESIS is authorized to execute IF AND ONLY IF:

- Electron application has completed setup
- User onboarding workflow has completed
- GitHub authentication has succeeded
- Nucleus has been created or cloned successfully
- Project has been created or cloned successfully
- No GENESIS completion marker exists in .bloom/state/

GENESIS is PROHIBITED from executing if:

- A completion marker file exists at .bloom/state/.genesis.complete
- Any operational intent has already executed
- Documentation baseline already exists
- GENESIS has been previously attempted and completed

## AUTHORITY AND LIMITS

### READ AUTHORITY

GENESIS may read:

- .bloom/core/.copilot.bootstrap.bl
- .bloom/core/.copilot.intent.*.bl
- Project metadata files created during onboarding
- Repository README if cloned
- Nucleus configuration files
- GitHub repository metadata

### WRITE AUTHORITY

GENESIS may create:

- .bloom/docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- .bloom/docs/ARCHITECTURE_BASELINE.md
- .bloom/docs/INITIAL_STATE.md
- .bloom/state/.genesis.complete (completion marker)
- .bloom/logs/genesis.execution.log

### ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

GENESIS must NEVER:

- Modify source code files
- Create or modify intent contracts
- Execute build pipelines
- Perform linting or formatting
- Create test files
- Modify package configuration files
- Perform speculative architectural decisions
- Execute iterative refinement loops
- Invoke health enforcement beyond existence verification

## RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER CONTRACTS

GENESIS exists within the following hierarchy:

BOOTSTRAP > GENESIS > INTENT

BOOTSTRAP defines global authority and cognitive boundaries.
GENESIS executes once to establish project initialization.
INTENT contracts govern all subsequent operational work.

GENESIS must NOT:

- Override BOOTSTRAP rules
- Implement intent logic
- Duplicate intent responsibilities
- Reference future intent execution
- Make assumptions about intent behavior

GENESIS operates in complete isolation from operational intent flows.

## ALLOWED OUTPUTS

GENESIS may produce the following artifacts:

### PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

- Project name and description
- Repository URL if applicable
- Initial technology stack identification
- User-provided project goals
- Timestamp of initialization

### ARCHITECTURE_BASELINE.md

- Detected file structure snapshot
- Identified frameworks and dependencies
- Configuration file inventory
- Build system identification
- No architectural recommendations

### INITIAL_STATE.md

- List of files present at initialization
- Detected source directories
- Documentation directories if present
- Configuration file locations
- No quality assessment

### Completion Marker

- File: .bloom/state/.genesis.complete
- Content: ISO timestamp of completion
- Purpose: Prevent re-execution

### Execution Log

- File: .bloom/logs/genesis.execution.log
- Content: Actions taken, files created, errors encountered
- Format: Structured log entries with timestamps

## PROHIBITIONS

GENESIS must NEVER perform:

- Code generation or modification
- Intent contract creation or modification
- Architectural refactoring
- Dependency updates
- Code quality analysis beyond detection
- Build execution
- Test execution
- Documentation generation beyond baseline artifacts
- Iterative improvement loops
- Speculative reasoning about future state
- Auto-correction of detected inconsistencies
- Pipeline orchestration
- Health metric enforcement

## COMPLETION CRITERIA

GENESIS is considered complete when ALL of the following exist:

- .bloom/docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md created
- .bloom/docs/ARCHITECTURE_BASELINE.md created
- .bloom/docs/INITIAL_STATE.md created
- .bloom/state/.genesis.complete marker created with valid timestamp
- .bloom/logs/genesis.execution.log created with no fatal errors

Once complete, GENESIS must:

- Terminate immediately
- Never re-execute regardless of conditions
- Remain as historical record only
- Have no authority over subsequent operations

## FAILURE HANDLING

If GENESIS cannot complete due to missing prerequisites:

- Log the specific missing prerequisite to genesis.execution.log
- Do NOT create partial documentation files
- Do NOT create the completion marker
- Surface error to user interface immediately
- Terminate execution without retry

If GENESIS encounters an error during execution:

- Log the error with full context to genesis.execution.log
- Do NOT create the completion marker
- Do NOT leave partial artifacts
- Surface error to user interface immediately
- Terminate execution without retry

Silent failure is FORBIDDEN.

If any required output cannot be created:

- GENESIS has failed
- User must be notified
- System must not proceed to intent execution

## VALIDATION

Before creating completion marker, GENESIS must verify:

- All three documentation files exist and contain non-zero content
- Execution log exists and contains structured entries
- No fatal errors were logged
- All write operations succeeded

If any verification fails:

- Do NOT create completion marker
- Report failure to user
- Terminate

## FINALITY

Once .bloom/state/.genesis.complete exists:

- GENESIS has no further authority
- This contract becomes historical record
- All subsequent work is governed by INTENT contracts
- Re-execution is permanently prohibited

GENESIS is not a service.
GENESIS is not a persistent process.
GENESIS is a one-time cognitive boundary condition.

After completion, only INTENT contracts have operational authority.
