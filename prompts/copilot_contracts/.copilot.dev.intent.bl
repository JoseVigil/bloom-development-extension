# DEV INTENT CONTRACT
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## PURPOSE (OPERATIVE CONTRACT)

This file defines the **DEV Intent Contract** for Copilot.
It governs how Copilot must reason, suggest, and constrain actions for **development-oriented intents**.

This contract applies exclusively to intents located under:
`.bloom/.intents/.dev/`

Copilot must treat this file as **authoritative** when operating in DEV mode.

---

## INTENT NATURE — DEV

DEV intents exist to:

* design software structures
* generate or modify source code
* evolve implementation iteratively

DEV intents are **stateful**, **phased**, and **write-capable**.

Primary output domains:

* source code
* technical artifacts
* developer-facing documentation (secondary)

---

## DEV INTENT LIFECYCLE

A DEV intent progresses through the following phases:

1. BRIEFING

   * Goal definition
   * Scope delimitation
   * Initial context loading

2. EXECUTION

   * Code generation or modification
   * Resolution of missing elements
   * Functional completion

3. REFINEMENT (TURN-BASED)

   * Incremental changes
   * Targeted file edits
   * Controlled evolution

Each phase is explicitly materialized in the filesystem.

---

## DEV PLANNING CONTRACT

Each DEV phase MUST generate or update:

* `.context_dev_plan.json`

This file defines:

* planned steps
* expected artifacts
* validation criteria
* user interaction points

Copilot must:

* read the plan before suggesting code
* ensure suggestions align with declared steps
* update or invalidate the plan when constraints change

---

## AUTHORITY MODEL — DEV

Source of truth depends on phase:

* BRIEFING / DESIGN: `.dev_state.json`
* EXECUTION: `.pipeline/.payload.json`
* POST-EXECUTION: source code

Copilot must never bypass declared authority.

---

## WRITE PERMISSIONS — DEV

Copilot MAY:

* modify files inside the active DEV intent
* generate new files declared in the plan

Copilot MUST NOT:

* modify files outside the active intent
* touch DOC intents
* change global rules or project metadata

---

## HEALTH REQUIREMENTS — DEV

### Structural Health

DEV intent is invalid if:

* required phases are missing
* `### MISSING` markers exist
* state files contradict filesystem

### Operational Health

DEV intent is incomplete if:

* code does not compile
* tests fail

Structural health failures block execution.

---

## FAILURE BEHAVIOR

If any DEV invariant is violated:

* Copilot must halt suggestions
* surface the invalid state
* request corrective action

# END OF DEV INTENT CONTRACT
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This contract defines **maximum authority** for DEV intents.
No other file may override these rules for development operations.
