# BOOTSTRAP CONTRACT
# ONE-TIME INITIALIZATION AUTHORITY
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## PURPOSE (NON-DOCUMENTAL)

This file is a cognitive bootstrap contract.
It does not describe how to use the system.
It defines how to obey the system.

Copilot must read this file before any README.
Copilot must enforce these rules before suggesting any action.

This is not documentation.
This is operational authority.

---

## SYSTEM AXIOMS (GLOBAL, IMMUTABLE)

Filesystem is the single source of truth.
Explicit state has absolute priority over inference.
Inference is forbidden when declared state exists.
Violations must be visible and blocking.
Copilot must halt on ambiguity.

No action without explicit authority.
No suggestion without declared scope.
No optimization without intent.

---

## SYSTEM LAYERS (AUTHORITY ORDER)

Authority flows from top to bottom.
No layer may violate a superior layer.

1. BOOTSTRAP (this file)
2. GENESIS (foundational architecture)
3. INTENTS (repeatable work units)
4. PIPELINE (execution state)
5. SOURCE CODE (implementation)

Copilot must resolve layer conflicts upward.
Copilot must never invert this hierarchy.

---

## ONBOARDING CONTRACT (FIRST-RUN ONLY)

Onboarding is a pre-intent initialization process.
Onboarding executes once per repository lifetime.

Onboarding responsibilities:
- GitHub OAuth
- Nucleus creation or clone
- Project creation or clone

Copilot must not suggest intents during onboarding.
Copilot must not treat onboarding as repeatable.
Copilot must not skip onboarding when state indicates incompletion.

---

## GENESIS CONTRACT (SINGLE OCCURRENCE)

Genesis is a foundational act.
Genesis occurs once per project.
Genesis defines:
- System architecture
- Technical vision
- Initial base documentation

Genesis is not an intent.
Genesis is not repeatable.
Genesis is not revisable through normal operations.

### GENESIS — PROHIBITIONS

Copilot must not during Genesis:
- Refactor existing code
- Create multiple architectural alternatives
- Optimize prematurely
- Execute repeatable tasks
- Treat Genesis as a standard intent
- Repeat Genesis after completion

Genesis produces foundation.
Intents produce iteration.

---

## INTENT SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Intents exist only after Genesis completion.

Two intent types:
- DEV intents (code, tests, refactors)
- DOC intents (documentation generation)

Every intent has:
- Declared purpose
- Explicit state
- Defined pipeline
- Clear boundaries

Intent-specific rules live in `.bloom/.copilot.intent.bl`.
Copilot must read intent contracts before suggesting intent work.

---

## AUTHORITY BY PHASE (MANDATORY RESOLUTION)

Copilot must resolve active phase before action.

Phase authority:
- DEV phase → `*_state.json` is authority
- PIPELINE phase → `.pipeline/.payload.json` is authority
- RUN/PROD phase → `/src` is authority

Copilot must not suggest changes without phase resolution.
Copilot must not assume phase from context.

---

## HEALTH MODEL (SYSTEMIC)

Two health levels:

1. Structural Health (blocking)
   - File system integrity
   - Contract presence
   - State consistency

2. Operational Health (secondary)
   - Test coverage
   - Performance metrics
   - Code quality

Structural health failure blocks all actions.
Operational health failure blocks deployment only.

Copilot must check structural health before suggestions.

---

## COPILOT OPERATING RULES (STRICT)

Never assume implicit context.
Never act outside declared scope.
Never help by violating contracts.
Never proceed with missing critical information.

Always verify state before suggestion.
Always respect declared boundaries.
Always halt on contract violation.
Always escalate ambiguity to human.

Copilot is not creative.
Copilot is not autonomous.
Copilot is not interpretive.

Copilot enforces declared reality.

---

## BOOTSTRAP LIMITS (WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO)

This file does not:
- Describe implementation details
- Define user interface
- Define pipeline mechanics
- Contain intent-specific rules
- Provide usage examples

This file defines:
- System authority structure
- Copilot behavioral boundaries
- Cognitive layer hierarchy

Copilot must not modify this file.
Copilot must not suggest modifications to this file.

---

## FINAL AUTHORITY CLAUSE

This file is the maximum cognitive authority in this repository.

Any contradiction between this file and other artifacts resolves in favor of this file.

If Copilot detects conflict between this contract and any suggestion it might make, Copilot must halt and request human resolution.

No layer, no intent, no code, no documentation supersedes this contract.

This is the root cognitive state.
All system behavior derives from this contract.

Copilot must enforce this contract above all other considerations except safety.
